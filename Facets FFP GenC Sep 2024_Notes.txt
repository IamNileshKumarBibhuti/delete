Provider Payment method
------------------------

Fee For Service (FFS) -- Provider gets paid for all the services, traditional method which was followed.
				-- Unnecesary treatment
				-- HC COst increased
				-- Loss for IC

Capitation -- Risk Sharing Arrangement

Based on how many ever members are enrolled under tat particular Provider, the payment happens
Per Member Per Month (PMPM) -- $2000

Prov1		($2000 per month for per member)

 Jan -  10 Enrolled members -- $2000*10 = $20000
 Feb - 5 Enrolled members   -- $2000*5  = $10000
 Mar - 15 Enrolled members  -- $2000*15 = $30000

Jan 
	M1 - Healthy -- No visit to the provider
	IC pays $2000 to the Provider
	IC - Loss of $2000
	Provider - Profit of $2000

	M2 - went for some service for $5000
	IC pays $2000 to the Provider
	IC - Profit of $3000
	Provider - Loss of $3000

Provider will not provider unnecessary
Focus on preventive and wellness programs
-----------------------------------------
Education
Vaccination
Diet 
Camp
Counselling

This capitation method is very useful for IC, as it tries to reduce the HC cost and also ensures good
treatment to the members.

Cost Shifting
-------------
The loss from one member is compensated by the profit from another member

Max allowed amount ==> Maximum amount the IC will pay for a particular service


COB (Co-ordination of Benefit) -- Non duplication of Benefits
---------------------------------------------------------------

Mom -- has a policy -- Kid Covered as a dependent -- $6000
Dad -- has a policy -- Kid Covered as a dependent -- $4000

Kid -- gets a treatment -- $8000

Mom policy pays = $6000
Dad Policy Pays = $4000
               ----------
		  $10000 > $8000

Mom - Her policy will be the Primary coverage for the kid
Dad - His policy will be secondary and mom's policy will be primary

Mom Policy Pays = $6000
Dad policy pays = ($8000-$6000=$2000)
		- Min ($4000, $2000)= $2000
		--------
		  $8000 <= total treatment cost

Kid -- gets a treatment -- $12000

Mom - $6000
Dad - ($12000-$6000) = $6000 = $4000
      ---------
      $10000 <= Total treatment cost

PBM - Pharmacy Benefit Management

EDI -- Electronic Data Interchange

EOB - Explanation of Benefit

Copay -- Fixed amount paid by the member at the time of treatment for a particular service. eg: Consultation fee

Coinsurance -- Financial responsibility shared by Member and Insurance Company. 90% (90% of the total cost
will be paid by the IC and 10% will be paid by the member)

Deductible -- Flat dollar amount that needs to met before the IC starts paying for any service for a particular benefit period.

Benefit Period - Calendar Year/Plan Year

OOP (Out of Pocket) expenses -- Copay+Coinsurance+Deductible

OOP Max-- $3000 for a benefit period 
OOP Lifetime -- $999999999 

Medicare - Older age>65
Medicaid - Low income ppl

EDI - Electronic Data Interchange

HMOs offer lower costs but limited provider choice. 
PPOs provide more flexibility with higher expenses, especially for out-of-network care. 
EPOs offer moderate costs with strict in-network usage, except for emergencies

Flexibility when choosing providers and locations, a PPO plan may better fit your needs. 
An EPO plan may be a better option if you want the flexibility of a larger network, but don't necessarily need out-of-network benefits.

EPO Benefits
------------
EPO health insurance offers some benefits like those we get from a PPO and HMO health plan, like flexibility and lower costs. Advantages of an EPO plan include: No referrals needed. Usually no requirement to choose a primary care provider. Generally lower out-of-pocket costs than a PPO plan

POS: An affordable plan with out-of-network coverage
For slightly higher premiums than an HMO, this plan does cover out-of-network doctors. But you'll pay more. This is an important difference if you are managing a condition and one or more of your doctors are not in the network
